Code for South Africa Best Practices
====================================

Best practices within Code for South Africa. They help ensure consistency across what we
build so that we can produce great products quickly, collaborate easily and fix bugs with
minimum fuss and downtime.

These are recommendations. They're strongly encouraged, but aren't rules. If
you need to do something differently, check with a colleague and motivate your
choices.
