Freelance Contracting
---------------------

Best practises:

- Price and contract based on value of deliverables, rather than time.
- Specify a due date
  - In UpWork you need to use the desktop version of the website where there's a dedicated due date field when you sign the contract.
- Be very specific about deliverables:
  - What tests are needed?
  - What documentation is needed?
  - What device/form factor support is needed?
- If there is a previous example you can refer to, do so. It can help to see how it's been done before, as long as it's clear how this iteration is different.
  
Some additional thoughts:

- Be fair, but firm. It's a business relationship. There's value in maintaining it, but you're contracting to get things done.
- Imagine difficult exchanges from their perspective - how would you like to be treated if you were the freelancer? What do you think would be fair to expect of you?
