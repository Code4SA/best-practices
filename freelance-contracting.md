Freelance Contracting
---------------------

Best practises:

- Price and contract based on value of deliverables, rather than time.
- Specify a due date
- Be very specific about deliverables:
  - What tests are needed?
  - What documentation is needed?
  - What device/form factor support is needed?
  
Some additional thoughts:

- Be fair, but firm. It's a business relationship. There's value in maintaining it, but you're contracting to get things done.
- Imagine difficult exchanges from their perspective - how would you like to be treated if you were the freelancer? What do you think would be fair to expect of you?
